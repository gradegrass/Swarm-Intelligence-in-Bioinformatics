#### Abstract <br>
In gene expression analysis and classification, feature selection is an important process selecting the subset of relevant features or useful data for further study and prediction.    Various methods have been adopted to tackle complex feature/gene selection problems, where evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have recently attracted researchersâ€™ attention, shown some promising results, and enhanced many real-world tasks. Biological inspired computing has successfully been used in many tasks that need simplicity in computation, optimized intelligence search and machine learning techniques. This paper presents an up-to-date study of the recent applications of Swarm Intelligence (SI) for optimizing feature selection process in Microarray data for human cancer classification and prediction. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the reviewed approaches with respect to their experimental settings and performance metrics. Furthermore, emerging challenges and implementation limitations are also addressed to identify other potential EC techniques for future work.
